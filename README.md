SIM password wallet is an Android application interacting with a JavaCard applet installed on SIM card. This application stores a list of encrypted password. The encryption/decryption process only takes place on SIM card (UICC). It uses [Open Mobile API](https://github.com/seek-for-android/pool/wiki/SmartcardAPI) to communicate with SIM card.

2 modes are available :

* passwords stored on application (SQLite db)
* passwords stored on SIM card (EEPROM)

You can switch from one mode to another easily and data are migrated correctly from the app storage to SIM EEPROM and vice versa.

In both modes, AES 128 CBC is used on UICC to encrypt/decrypt passwords.

A pin code must be configured the first time user open the app. The pin code security part comes from [this tutorial from Eric VÃ©tillard](https://github.com/bertrandmartel/javacard-tutorial#jc101-password-pin--password-application-with-pin-security). This pin code can be changed using the options menu.
